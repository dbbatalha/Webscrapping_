R$25 on the door per person and reasonably priced drinks inside. Real local people, dancing and having fun, just fantastic. An absolute must! The staff were excellent. Yes they want you to stay, yes they want you to spend more money but so what! At the end of the night we needed an Uber. No WiFi but beardy guy on the till sorted it on his own phone. He was great!! We leave on Friday but I defo want to come again. So what do I mean in my title? Matt & Phreds is a great live music venue in Manchester. This place has the same earthy, real vibe!

It's hard to imagine they'd get away with that for long if they shorted the local clientele, so it must be something they only try with foreigners, which we very obviously were. Maybe it's because we were coming from an event and were in black tie -- a very odd sight in Rio -- and they thought we were too weird for words and didn't want us hanging out for long. Who knows. All of that said, the music rocked and the food was WAY better than you'd expect in a night cub, and I would go back, but next time I'd let them know that we'd be more likely to keep ordering drinks if they had a little buzz in them.

I adore the place, the musicians and singers are so talented, everyone is very friendly and it is pretty much guaranteed fun. You pay the entrance at the door (always at the door i have never been charged for it subsequently). At least one of the doormen speaks English and is a nice guy, i don't know if he is always there. Once you are in you will get given cards with every single item you can order on it, and every time you order something they will tick it. Before leaving you pay at the till and they will hand a proof of payment that you show the doorman on exit. For simplicity's sake we always put everything on the one card. The waiters are very experienced and generally they are completely on top of it, i'll just shake my glass in their direction and they'll come with a refill and tick my husband's card :). On the subject of prices if i remember well the entrance is R25 to R35 max per person (\u00a36-9), the food is fairly cheap and a Caipirinha is R11 (about \u00a33!). Beer a bit more i can't remember exactly. You will pay about R7 for a Caipirinha on the beach and up to R25 in a restaurant so R11 is not exactly extortionate. I can't remember all the details but on our last visit in December the whole evening cost us about \u00a350/\u00a360 for 2, that was including entrance, pizza (1 each-not traditional but fairly tasty), and drinks all night from 8pm to 2am (coffee, water, a few beers, quite a few Caipirinhas each). I reckon that is pretty exceptional value for a night of eating, drinking, dancing and live music. At the end of the day prices in Rio are more London/NYC than Bangkok so you have to set your expectations at the right sort of level.

Dress is casual, but Brazilians will be stylish nonetheless. The live show started with a band and a few spotlight performers came up throughout the night who were amazing- our video recordings don't do it justice. The crowd was fun and friendly, the pizza we ordered was great. Drinks and food get added to a tab that you pay up at the end, and although it was expensive, it was well worth it for an entire evening of fun.

A few hints to help fellow travelers: 1) exceptional musicians, groups and singers play at Carioca da Gema, where in general there are two daily shows. Check the shows on their website before going; 2) it is noisy, crowded, sometimes overcrowded - it is a place to drink, dance and enjoy Brazilian \"samba\" and \"choro\" music at their best tradition. At the beginning of the week it is not so crowded (as it is on Fridays and Saturdays), what may be a little disappointing, if you are imagining a real crowd carnival style; 3) do not expect great gastronomy: the appetizers are correct and the beer is great; 4) if you want a good table, arrive early and get in the mood - if sad or depressed stay home, or go: you might recover. If you don't get a table, it is no big deal, as you are at Carioca da Gema to dance and enjoy yourself - get as close to the stage as you can; 5) if you have a Brazilian friend, go with him/her: Portuguese speaking helps a lot. Locals also attend Carioca da Gema and it's quite commom to see groups of friends celebrating something. This is the spirit of the house: a place for celebrating life and wellness; 6) be aware of the entrance fee (check it also, as it varies according to performer and day of the week). Food and beverage prices are correct and go along with those practiced in Rio de Janeiro, a city that is internationally recognized as \"expensive\"; 7) go and come back always by taxi: never walk on Lapa's street alone at any time.

The band was absolutely amazing, I felt like I was at Carnival.  The club is tiny, but we arrived early and got a great table with a view.

Carioca da Gema is a genuine samba house - most of the people were locals - that gets crowded very very early (the first show started at 9pm and the second one was scheduled for 12pm). So, if you prefer to have your own table to sit down every now and then (dancing samba can be exausting!), I strongly suggest that you call and make your reservation beforehand.", "comentario_nota": "5.0 of 5 bubbles", "comentario_data": null},

The only trouble is, there are few tables with stage view, so be prepared to stand! Of course, you can dance too!
